## What Is CProvider?

CProvider is a rewrite of [CUE4Parse](https://github.com/FabianFG/CUE4Parse) designed to fit Galaxy Swapper.

## What Is Different?

CProvider is tailored to the sole purpose of reading utoc files to export an asset. It does not parse assets in any way, unlike Cue4Parse.

## Why is this important?

Given that Galaxy Swapper only requires asset export, CProvider streamlines the process by eliminating unnecessary components and optimizing it to meet Galaxy Swapper's requirements. This results in approximately 30% memory usage reduction and a 50% increase in parsing speed.

## Intended Exclusively for Galaxy Swapper:

CProvider is designed solely for use with Galaxy Swapper and is not meant to be used as a standalone package. It serves the specific purpose of assisting Galaxy Swapper and is optimized to enhance its functionality.
